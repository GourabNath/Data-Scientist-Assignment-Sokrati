=====================================
###Time Series Forecasting

The file contains measurement of some unspecified metric by date and hour of the day. No other variable is being provided.

What is to be done?
Develop a model to predict the metric, given a date and hour of the day.
Develop a model preferably in R or Python.
If not familiar with these it is alright to use Clojure/Incanter, Scala, Java/Weka, Octave/C/C++ or any other open source library.
Use of proprietary tools like SAS/SPSS is strongly discouraged.
You can use any model that you want, however you need to justify the choice of the model.
You can use any transformation of the input variable. In fact, we are looking at how creative can you get with the possible variable transformations.
We would really like if you think beyond usual suspects like linear regression

What you need to submit?
Submit a 5 line explanation of your approach. Also answer the following questions
Is there a pattern in the value of the output variable? What is the pattern?
Does the particular pattern make it easy to model the problem or difficult? Why?
Which parts of the code helped you determine the nature of the pattern?
Why did you choose a particular model for forecasting the values?
Why did you use a particular transformation of the input?
Submit complete code that you've used for completing this part. Ensure that the code is well commented.
Also include 5-10 test examples where you predict the metric value using a sample input.
